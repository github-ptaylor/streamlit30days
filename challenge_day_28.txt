streamlit-shap is a Streamlit component that provides a wrapper to display SHAP plots in Streamlit.

The library is developed by our in-house staff Snehan Kekre who also maintains the Streamlit Documentation website.

Firstly, install Streamlit (of course!) then pip install the streamlit-shap library:


pip install streamlit
pip install streamlit-shap

There are also other prerequisite libraries to install (e.g. matplotlib, pandas, scikit-learn and xgboost) if you haven't yet done so.
